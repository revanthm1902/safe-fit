# Face API.js Models

This directory contains the necessary face-detection and expression-recognition models for face-api.js.

To complete the setup, please download the following files from the face-api.js GitHub repository 
or download from the official distribution and place them in this directory:

1. `tiny_face_detector_model-weights_manifest.json`
2. `tiny_face_detector_model-shard1`
3. `face_landmark_68_model-weights_manifest.json`
4. `face_landmark_68_model-shard1`
5. `face_expression_model-weights_manifest.json`
6. `face_expression_model-shard1`
7. `face_recognition_model-weights_manifest.json`
8. `face_recognition_model-shard1`
9. `face_recognition_model-shard2`

These models enable the BroAI feature to detect faces and read facial expressions to provide
emotion-aware responses.
